two phases


1. INDEXING: User Provide data
2. Retrieval: User Chat with DATA


#### INDEXING
1. User provides few documents to get indexed.
2. Split the data into CHUNKS.
  ---HOW?  :   Split into Paragrahs.
3. Embedding Model: Every chunk is given to the Embedding Model and create Vector Embeddings.
4. Vector Database: Vector DB, All chunks are stored into Vector DB.


#### RETRIEVAL
1. Query Provided by user.
2. Query converted into vector embeddings.
3. A query is done in Vector DB which is called VECTOR SIMILARITY SEARCH and the similar, relevant chunks are returned by the Vector DB.
4. SYSTEM PROMPT: It has now only the valid data, the relevant chunks (cosy effective)
