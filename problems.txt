"""PROBLEMS WITH CONVERTING PDF DATA DIRECTLY INTO LLM SYSTEM PROMPT
=====================================================================

1. TOKEN LIMITATION PROBLEM
---------------------------
Large PDFs (500–1000 pages) can easily contain millions of characters.
LLMs have strict token limits (e.g., 8k, 32k, 128k tokens).

If the entire PDF text is added to the system prompt:
- The request will fail due to token overflow
- The model may truncate important information
- Costs increase exponentially

Example:
1000-page PDF ≈ 500,000+ tokens
LLM limit ≈ 32,000 tokens → NOT POSSIBLE


2. HIGH COST PROBLEM
-------------------
LLMs charge based on tokens processed.

If full PDF text is sent on every request:
- Cost multiplies for each query
- Same data is reprocessed again and again
- Completely inefficient for production systems

Example:
If 1 query costs ₹5
100 queries cost ₹500 for the SAME DATA


3. PERFORMANCE & LATENCY ISSUE
------------------------------
Sending massive text as a prompt:
- Slows down API calls
- Increases response latency
- Makes the system unusable for real-time chat

Large prompts = slower inference


4. NO SEMANTIC SEARCH
---------------------
LLMs do not automatically know where information exists in a long prompt.

Problems:
- The model scans the entire text blindly
- Cannot reliably locate "page 32"
- Answers may be hallucinated or inaccurate


5. CONTEXT DILUTION
-------------------
When too much text is given:
- Important sections lose priority
- Model may focus on irrelevant content
- Accuracy drops significantly

More context ≠ Better answers


6. NO SCALABILITY
----------------
If a new PDF is added:
- Entire system prompt must be rewritten
- Old prompts become invalid
- System becomes unmaintainable

Not suitable for enterprise use


7. MEMORY WASTAGE
-----------------
The same PDF content is sent repeatedly:
- Wastes context window
- Prevents meaningful conversation history
- Reduces ability to follow user intent


8. SECURITY & PRIVACY RISKS
---------------------------
Embedding full documents in prompts:
- Increases exposure of sensitive data
- Makes access control impossible
- Hard to log or audit data usage


9. NO SOURCE TRACEABILITY
-------------------------
LLM responses:
- Cannot reliably say where the answer came from
- No page number or reference
- Difficult to verify correctness


10. MAINTENANCE NIGHTMARE
------------------------
Any update in the PDF:
- Requires regenerating prompts
- Manual intervention needed
- Error-prone workflow


CONCLUSION
----------
Providing entire PDF text directly to an LLM as a system prompt is:
❌ Inefficient
❌ Expensive
❌ Unscalable
❌ Inaccurate

This is why Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the correct and
industry-standard solution for Chat-with-PDF systems.

RAG ensures:
✔ Only relevant data is sent to the LLM
✔ Lower cost
✔ Faster responses
✔ Higher accuracy
✔ Enterprise scalability
